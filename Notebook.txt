Below is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow implementing the automated Docker image pull/push and Wiz/Snyk scanning features as described in the design document:


# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Docker Registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: my_registry.example.com
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Pull Docker Image
      run: docker pull my_registry.example.com/my_image:latest

    - name: Scan with Wiz
      run: |
        docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e WIZ_API_KEY=${{ secrets.WIZ_API_KEY }} wiz wiz/docker:latest scan my_registry.example.com/my_image:latest
        wiz get-results --api-key=${{ secrets.WIZ_API_KEY }} --format json > wiz-results.json

    - name: Scan with Snyk
      run: |
        docker pull snyk/snyk-cli:docker
        docker run --rm -e SNYK_TOKEN=${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }} -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v "$(pwd)/snyk:/project" snyk/snyk-cli:docker docker scan my_registry.example.com/my_image:latest --file=snyk-results.json

    - name: Analyze Scan Results
      run: python analyze_scan_results.py

    - name: Push Docker Image
      run: docker push my_registry.example.com/my_image:latest

    - name: Notify Results
      uses: actions/github-script@v5
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        script: |
          const fs = require('fs');
          const scan_results = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('scan-results-summary.json', 'utf-8'));
          const pr_number = context.payload.number;
          const message = `### Scan Results:\n${scan_results.message}\n\n**Status:** ${scan_results.status ? '✅ Passed' : '❌ Failed'}`;
          if (pr_number) {
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: pr_number,
              body: message,
            });
          }







This GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered upon a push or pull request event in the main branch. It first checks out the repository, sets up Docker Buildx, and logs in to the Docker registry. Then, it pulls the Docker image and scans it with both Wiz and Snyk scanners. After analyzing the scan results, the workflow pushes the Docker image to the registry and notifies the results as a comment on the PR (if applicable).



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i have list of images for example nginx and i want to search the dockerhub every week for the latest image release and it should pull from the dockerhub and scan and it should upload to artifactory 

You can create a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow to search Docker Hub for the latest image releases, pull them, scan with Wiz and Snyk, and then push the scanned images to Artifactory. Here's an example workflow:

# .github/workflows/scheduled_image_update.yml
name: Scheduled Image Update

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Runs every Monday at 00:00

jobs:
  update_images:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
      DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
      ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
      ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: registry.hub.docker.com
        username: ${{ env.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Login to Artifactory
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: my_artifactory.example.com
        username: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Pull Latest Images and Scan
      run: |
        declare -a images=("nginx")
        for image in "${images[@]}"; do
          latest_tag=$(curl -s -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/$image/tags/?page_size=10 | jq '.results[].name' | grep -v "alpine\|mainline" | grep -E "^[0-9]" | sort -V -r | head -1 | tr -d '"')
          echo "Latest tag for $image: $latest_tag"
          docker pull $image:$latest_tag
          # Scan with Wiz and Snyk (use the scanning steps from the previous example)
          docker tag $image:$latest_tag my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
          docker push my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
        done


In this example, the workflow is scheduled to run every week (Monday 00:00) using the cron syntax. The images array stores the list of images you want to update. For each image, the workflow retrieves the latest tag from Docker Hub, pulls the image, scans it with Wiz and Snyk (as shown in the previous example), tags the image with the Artifactory registry, and pushes it to Artifactory.

You need to add the required secrets (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD, ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME, and ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD) in your GitHub repository settings.

The example above uses jq to parse JSON output. Make sure to include the following step to install jq before using it in the workflow:

- name: Install JQ
  run: sudo apt-get install jq


You can modify the "Pull Latest Images and Scan" step in the workflow to read the image names from images.txt:

- name: Pull Latest Images and Scan
  run: |
    while read image; do
      latest_tag=$(curl -s -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/$image/tags/?page_size=10 | jq '.results[].name' | grep -v "alpine\|mainline" | grep -E "^[0-9]" | sort -V -r | head -1 | tr -d '"')
      echo "Latest tag for $image: $latest_tag"
      docker pull $image:$latest_tag
      # Scan with Wiz and Snyk (use the scanning steps from the previous example)
      docker tag $image:$latest_tag my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
      docker push my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
    done < images.txt


This will read the image names from the images.txt file in your repository and process each image one by one, retrieving the latest tag from Docker Hub, pulling the image, scanning it with Wiz and Snyk, and pushing it to Artifactory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to manually enter the image version in the GitHub Actions workflow, you can use GitHub Actions' workflow_dispatch event, which allows you to manually trigger the workflow with input parameters.

Here's an example workflow that accepts image name and version as input parameters:

# .github/workflows/manual_image_update.yml
name: Manual Image Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      image_name:
        description: 'Docker image name (e.g., nginx)'
        required: true
      image_version:
        description: 'Docker image version (e.g., 1.21.3)'
        required: true

jobs:
  update_image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
      DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
      ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
      ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: registry.hub.docker.com
        username: ${{ env.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Login to Artifactory
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: my_artifactory.example.com
        username: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Pull Specified Image and Scan
      run: |
        image=${{ github.event.inputs.image_name }}
        version=${{ github.event.inputs.image_version }}
        docker pull $image:$version
        # Scan with Wiz and Snyk (use the scanning steps from the previous example)
        docker tag $image:$version my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$version
        docker push my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$version



With this workflow, you can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab in your repository, and you'll be prompted to enter the image name and version. The workflow will then pull the specified image, scan it with Wiz and Snyk, and push it to Artifactory.

Please note that you need to replace the placeholder comments with the actual scanning steps for Wiz and Snyk, as shown in the previous examples.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can pull public images from Docker Hub without logging in. You can remove the "Login to Docker Hub" step from the workflow if you are only dealing with public images. Here's the modified workflow that skips Docker Hub login:

# .github/workflows/manual_image_update.yml
name: Manual Image Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      image_name:
        description: 'Docker image name (e.g., nginx)'
        required: true
      image_version:
        description: 'Docker image version (e.g., 1.21.3)'
        required: true

jobs:
  update_image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
      ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Artifactory
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: my_artifactory.example.com
        username: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Pull Specified Image and Scan
      run: |
        image=${{ github.event.inputs.image_name }}
        version=${{ github.event.inputs.image_version }}
        docker pull $image:$version
        # Scan with Wiz and Snyk (use the scanning steps from the previous example)
        docker tag $image:$version my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$version
        docker push my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$version


With this modification, the workflow will still pull the specified public image from Docker Hub, scan it with Wiz and Snyk, and push it to Artifactory without requiring Docker Hub login credentials.


------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that meets your requirements:

Pull the latest images from a public repository (Docker Hub).
Scan the images with Snyk.
Push the images to JFrog Artifactory if the vulnerability level is normal or lower.
Schedule the workflow to run every day.

# .github/workflows/daily_image_update.yml
name: Daily Image Update

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs every day at 00:00

jobs:
  update_images:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
      ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Artifactory
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: my_artifactory.example.com
        username: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Install JQ
      run: sudo apt-get install jq

    - name: Pull Latest Images, Scan and Push if Vulnerability is Normal
      run: |
        while read image; do
          latest_tag=$(curl -s https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/$image/tags/?page_size=10 | jq '.results[].name' | grep -v "alpine\|mainline" | grep -E "^[0-9]" | sort -V -r | head -1 | tr -d '"')
          echo "Latest tag for $image: $latest_tag"
          docker pull $image:$latest_tag

          # Scan with Snyk
          snyk_report=$(snyk container test --severity-threshold=low $image:$latest_tag --json --quiet)
          snyk_issues=$(echo "$snyk_report" | jq '.issues')
          snyk_vulnerabilities=$(echo "$snyk_report" | jq '.vulnerabilities')

          if [ -z "$snyk_vulnerabilities" ]; then
            echo "No vulnerabilities found in $image:$latest_tag"
            docker tag $image:$latest_tag my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
            docker push my_artifactory.example.com/$image:$latest_tag
          else
            echo "Vulnerabilities found in $image:$latest_tag"
            echo "$snyk_issues"
          fi
        done < images.txt


Before using this workflow, make sure you have added the required secrets (SNYK_TOKEN, ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME, and ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD) in your GitHub repository settings.

In this example, the workflow reads the list of images from a file called images.txt in your repository, which should contain one image name per line. The workflow fetches the latest tag for each image, pulls the image from Docker Hub, scans it with Snyk, and pushes it to Artifactory if the vulnerability level is normal or lower.

Please note that in this example, only low-severity vulnerabilities are allowed. If you need to adjust the allowed severity level, you can modify the --severity-threshold option in the snyk container test command.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
Monitor the progress of the workflow and verify that it's running as expected.
Check the output of the scanning process and the images pushed to Artifactory.
By following these steps, you can set up an automated process for updating Docker images, scanning them for vulnerabilities, and pushing them to JFrog Artifactory using GitHub Actions. Customize and expand the workflow as needed to fit your specific requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's an example of how to set up the automated Docker image update and vulnerability scanning process with GitHub Actions, including the images.txt file and the complete GitHub Actions workflow.

Create an images.txt file in your GitHub repository containing the images and their versions:
nginx:1.21.3
redis:6.2.6
postgres:13.4

Create a new directory .github/workflows/ in your GitHub repository.

Create a new YAML file named daily_image_update.yml in the .github/workflows/ directory with the following content:

name: Daily Image Update

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs every day at 00:00

jobs:
  update_images:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
      ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to Artifactory
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: artifactory.example.com
        username: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ env.ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Install JQ
      run: sudo apt-get install jq

    - name: Pull Images with Versions, Scan, and Push if Vulnerability is Normal
      run: |
        while IFS=":" read -r image version; do
          echo "Processing $image:$version"
          docker pull $image:$version

          # Scan with Snyk
          snyk_report=$(snyk container test --severity-threshold=low $image:$version --json --quiet)
          snyk_issues=$(echo "$snyk_report" | jq '.issues')
          snyk_vulnerabilities=$(echo "$snyk_report" | jq '.vulnerabilities')

          if [ -z "$snyk_vulnerabilities" ]; then
            echo "No vulnerabilities found in $image:$version"
            docker tag $image:$version artifactory.example.com/docker/$image:$version
            docker push artifactory.example.com/docker/$image:$version
          else
            echo "Vulnerabilities found in $image:$version"
            echo "$snyk_issues"
          fi
        done < images.txt



Remember to replace artifactory.example.com with the domain name of your JFrog Artifactory instance.

Follow the step-by-step guide provided earlier to set up the required GitHub secrets and verify the workflow.
After completing these steps, your GitHub repository will have an automated process that pulls the specified Docker images, scans them for vulnerabilities using Snyk, and pushes them to your JFrog Artifactory instance if the vulnerability level is normal or lower.
